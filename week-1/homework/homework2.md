Q1. Modular arithmetic - you just need to find examples, you don't need to prove anything.

a) Is it true that all odd squares are â‰¡ 1 (mod 8)?

b) what about even squares (mod 8) ?

A1] Yes for (a) and No for (b)

Q2. What do you understand by:

a) O(n)

b) O(1)

c) O(log n)

For a proof size, which of these would you want?

A2] These are Big O notations that represent the time taken for some computation on input size n. For a proof size, we would want (b)-O(1) since communication complexity between the prover and verifier would take constant time. This means that as input size n increases, the complexity remains constant in the order of 0(1).
