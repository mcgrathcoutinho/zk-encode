Q1. Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

What is:

a) 4 + 4

b) 3 x 5

c) what is the inverse of 3 ?

A1]

a) 8 = 8 mod 7 (since 7 elements in the set i.e. we wrap around to 0 when we reach 7) = 1

b) 15 = 15 mod 7 = 1

c) The additive inverse would be 4 since 3 + 4 = 7 = 7 mod 7 = 0. The multiplicative inverse would be 5 since 3 x 5 = 15 = 15 mod 7 = 1. Multiples of 4 and 5 also form inverses but we do not include them since they do not exist in the set of integers that we can use to perform operations.

Q2. For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?

A2] Yes since a group is just a set of elements and a binary operation which adhere to the properties of closure, associativity, identity element, inverse element.

Q3. What is -13 mod 5 ?

A3] -13 mod 5 = 2 (since 5 x 2 = 10, the remainder is 3. The negation sign means we wrap backwards. Now we just count 3 from the back i.e. 4, 3 ,2. Thus, 2 is the answer).

Q4. Polynomials

For the polynomial $x^3 − x^2 + 4x − 12$

Find a positive root ?

What is the degree of this polynomial ?

A4] Degree is the highest power of the polynomial i.e. 3.
